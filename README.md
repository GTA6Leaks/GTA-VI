This is a cracked version of Grand Theft Auto VI — the highly anticipated next installment in the GTA franchise. If you're eager to get your hands on the game before its official release, you've come to the right place.

Thanks to the Rockstar Games Social Club Beta, I’ve managed to bypass the restrictions and release the GTA VI launcher for early access. This cracked version allows you to experience GTA VI and its features right now, ahead of its global launch.

With this installation, you'll be able to:

Run GTA VI without needing to wait for Rockstar’s official release.
Access the game in a fully functional state (with some minor limitations for this cracked version).
Play around with features that are still under testing, and get a glimpse of what GTA VI will offer.
Please note: This is a beta version intended for early testing, and some online features may be unstable. Expect bugs or temporary errors, but overall, it provides a taste of what the final game will bring.

Installation:
Download and extract the ZIP file to any folder on your PC.
Inside the extracted folder, run launcher.exe to begin the setup.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Once the game is installed, you’ll be able to launch it directly through the launcher.exe.
Known Issues:
Online features may not work fully in this version.
Some graphical glitches may occur, as this is still in the beta phase.
Certain missions or game modes may be locked or incomplete.
